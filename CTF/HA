We can't get our hands directly on the password because it's stored in the HSM. The HSM checks the password and if it matches, it sets a byte in memory. After test_password_valid function completes, a byte at address 0x2410 is checked against 0x70. If it's equal, the door will be unlocked. We can overwrite this byte by overflowing the password buffer with a long input.
Password: 4141414141414141414141414141414170
