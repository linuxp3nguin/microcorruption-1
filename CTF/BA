DEP. We can overwrite PC as usual, but our data is mapped as not executable. From manual, its possible to mark page as executable, there's even function for that in the code.
We can easily overwrite the PC, however the memory where our shellcode resides is readonly. And there's no unlock_door to jump to, we need to launch our shellcode. There's a function called mark_page_executable, which makes a memory page executable. This is what we want to misuse. We have to place an address of a memory page with our shellcode at the stack. We control the stack so we point the return address to our now executable code.
We need the address of our code on the stack, then jump to mark_page_executable and set that page as executable. After ret from mark_page_executable, address of our shellcode is popped to PC.
